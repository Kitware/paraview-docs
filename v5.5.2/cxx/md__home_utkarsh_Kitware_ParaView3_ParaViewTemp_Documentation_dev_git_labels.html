<div class="textblock"><p><a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/labels">Labels</a> are used to annotate <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues">Issues</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/merge_requests">Merge Requests</a>. They help organize and provide information about their state in the development workflow.</p>
<p>Labels are named using the form <code>[category]:[name]</code>. Labels in the same category has the same color.</p>
<h2><code>area:...</code> </h2>
<p>Labels in this category identify a component of ParaView affected by the issue. Current list includes <code>area:catalyst</code>, <code>area:doc</code>, <code>area:packaging</code>, <code>area:third-party</code>, and <code>area:web</code>.</p>
<p>Reporters and developers can assign these labels to an issue to help organize.</p>
<h2><code>priority:...</code> </h2>
<p>An issue gets assigned a <b>Milestone</b> to indicate which release a fix for it is planned for. The <code>priority:...</code> label can be used to indicate how critical is this issue for that milestone.</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>label </th><th>issues </th><th>merge requests </th><th>description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>priority:required</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>issue is <b>required</b> for a milestone (highest priority) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>priority:important</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>issue is <b>important</b> for a milestone but may be okay if missed </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>priority:nice-to-have</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>issue is <b>nice-to-have</b>, but not critical or important </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>priority:low</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>low priority issues for a particular milestone </td></tr>
</table>
<p>If an issue targeted for a milestone has no priority label, then it is assumed the least priority.</p>
<h2><code>project:...</code> </h2>
<p>These labels are associated with Issues to identify the project/customer that wants the issue addressed. Project manager and developers working with their managers can use these labels to denote the stakeholders for a particular issue.</p>
<h2><code>triage:...</code> </h2>
<p>These labels can be assigned to Issues and Merge Requests to help triage as indicated in the table below:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>label </th><th>issues </th><th>merge requests </th><th>description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>triage:confirmed</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>issue has been confirmed by someone other than the reporter </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>triage:easy</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>added by developers to issues that are easy to fix </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>triage:expired</code> </td><td>x </td><td>x </td><td>added to issues closed without resolving or merge requests closed without merging due to lack of activity </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>triage:feature</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>issue is a feature request; can be added by developers or reporters </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>triage:needinfo</code> </td><td>x </td><td>x </td><td>on an open issue, this label is added to indicate that more information is needed from the reporter; on a closed issue, this label is added to indicate that more information is needed from the developer who closed the issue about how to test or review the issue; on a merge request this label is added to request more information from the developer before the merge request can be reviewed </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>triage:needswork</code> </td><td></td><td>x </td><td>added to merge requests after review if the reviewer deems it needs more work before it can be merged </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>triage:pending-dashboards</code> </td><td></td><td>x </td><td>added to merge requests that are awaiting dashboards before they can be reviewed or merged </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>triage:ready-for-review</code> </td><td></td><td>x </td><td>added to merge requests that are ready for review by a developer </td></tr>
</table>
<p>These labels may be removed if the issue or merge request is no longer in the state indicated by the label. For example, a merge request gets a <code>triage:ready-for-review</code> label to request another developer to review it. If the reviewer deems it needs more work, he should add the <code>triage:needswork</code> label and remove the <code>triage:ready-for-review</code> label since the latter is no longer applicable.</p>
<h2><code>workflow:...</code> </h2>
<p>These labels are added to issues to indicate their state in the development cycle. Similar to <code>priority:...</code>, there can only be at most one workflow label on an issue at a time.</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>label </th><th>issues </th><th>merge requests </th><th>description  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>workflow:active-developement</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>added to an open issue that is under development </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>workflow:customer-review</code> </td><td>x </td><td></td><td>added to a closed issue that is ready for review by the customer/reporter </td></tr>
