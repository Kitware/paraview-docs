Data Descriptors
----------------


   
   FileName
       ASCII .vpc file describes locations of data files, grid
       sizes, time step sizes and type and order of data written to the
       files.
   
   PointArrays
       Variables written to the data files are described in the
       .vpc file and are presented for selection. Only selected variables are
       loaded for a time step.
   
   Stride
       VPIC data may be very large and not all is needed for
       effective visualization. Setting the stride selects every nth data item
       within the files for display.
   
   TimestepValues
   
   XExtent
       VPIC data is written one file per simulation processor.
       This coarse map of files is used in partitioning files between
       visualizing processors so that each ParaView processor has its own set
       of files to display. Ghost cell overlap is handled within the reader.
       To limit the View of VPIC information the extent in the X dimension of
       "files" can be specified. Only the files selected will be displayed and
       they will be partitioned between the visualizing processors, allowing a
       higher resolution over a smaller area.
   
   YExtent
       VPIC data is written one file per simulation processor.
       This coarse map of files is used in partitioning files between
       visualizing processors so that each ParaView processor has its own set
       of files to display. Ghost cell overlap is handled within the reader.
       To limit the View of VPIC information the extent in the Y dimension of
       "files" can be specified. Only the files selected will be displayed and
       they will be partitioned between the visualizing processors, allowing a
       higher resolution over a smaller area.
   
   ZExtent

       visualizing processors so that each ParaView processor has its own set

Methods inherited from SourceProxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   FileNameChanged(self)
       Called when the filename of a source proxy is changed.
   
   GetCellDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetDataInformation(self, idx=None)
       This method returns a DataInformation wrapper around a
       vtkPVDataInformation
   
   GetFieldDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetPointDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated point data information.
   
   UpdatePipeline(self, time=None)
       This method updates the server-side VTK pipeline and the associated
       data information. Make sure to update a source to validate the output
       meta-data.
   
   UpdatePipelineInformation(self)
       This method updates the meta-data of the server-side VTK pipeline and
       the associated information properties
   
   __getitem__(self, idx)
       Given a slice, int or string, returns the corresponding
       output port
   
   

Methods inherited from Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   GetProperty(self, name)
       Given a property name, returns the property object.
   
   GetPropertyValue(self, name)
       Returns a scalar for properties with 1 elements, the property
       itself for vectors.
   
   InitializeFromProxy(self, aProxy, update=True)
       Constructor. Assigns proxy to self.SMProxy, updates the server
       object as well as register the proxy in _pyproxies dictionary.
   
   ListProperties(self)
       Returns a list of all property names on this proxy.
   
   SetPropertyWithName(self, pname, arg)
       Generic method for setting the value of a property.
   
   __del__(self)
       Destructor. Cleans up all observers as well as remove
       the proxy from the _pyproxies dictionary
   
   __eq__(self, other)
       Returns true if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __getattr__(self, name)
       With the exception of a few overloaded methods,
       returns the SMProxy method
   
   __hash__(self)
   
   __init__(self, \*\*args)
       Default constructor. It can be used to initialize properties
       by passing keyword arguments where the key is the name of the
       property. In addition registrationGroup and registrationName (optional)
       can be specified (as keyword arguments) to automatically register
       the proxy with the proxy manager.
   
   __iter__(self)
       Creates an iterator for the properties.
   
   __ne__(self, other)
       Returns false if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __setattr__(self, name, value)
   
   add_attribute(self, name, value)
