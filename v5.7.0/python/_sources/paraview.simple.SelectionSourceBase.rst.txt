Data Descriptors
----------------


   
   ContainingCells
       When field type is POINT, this controls whether single
       vertex cells will be produced for each selected point, or whether the
       cells that contain each selected point will be produced. When field
       type is CELL this has no effect.
   
   FieldType
       The location of the array the selection came from (ex,
       point, cell).
   
   InsideOut
       When this property is false the selection describes
       everything that should be extracted. When this is true the selection
       describes everything that should NOT be extracted.

Methods inherited from Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   GetProperty(self, name)
       Given a property name, returns the property object.
   
   GetPropertyValue(self, name)
       Returns a scalar for properties with 1 elements, the property
       itself for vectors.
   
   InitializeFromProxy(self, aProxy, update=True)
       Constructor. Assigns proxy to self.SMProxy, updates the server
       object as well as register the proxy in _pyproxies dictionary.
   
   ListProperties(self)
       Returns a list of all property names on this proxy.
   
   SetPropertyWithName(self, pname, arg)
       Generic method for setting the value of a property.
   
   __del__(self)
       Destructor. Cleans up all observers as well as remove
       the proxy from the _pyproxies dictionary
   
   __eq__(self, other)
       Returns true if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __getattr__(self, name)
       With the exception of a few overloaded methods,
       returns the SMProxy method
   
   __hash__(self)
       Return hash(self).
   
   __init__(self, \*\*args)
       Default constructor. It can be used to initialize properties
       by passing keyword arguments where the key is the name of the
       property. In addition registrationGroup and registrationName (optional)
       can be specified (as keyword arguments) to automatically register
       the proxy with the proxy manager.
   
   __iter__(self)
       Creates an iterator for the properties.
   
   __ne__(self, other)
       Returns false if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __setattr__(self, name, value)
       Implement setattr(self, name, value).
   
   add_attribute(self, name, value)
