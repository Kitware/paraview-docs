Data Descriptors
----------------


   
   ComputeVorticity
       Specify whether or not to compute
       vorticity.
   
   InitialStepLength
       This property specifies the initial integration step
       size. For non-adaptive integrators (Runge-Kutta 2 and Runge-Kutta 4),
       it is fixed (always equal to this initial value) throughout the
       integration. For an adaptive integrator (Runge-Kutta 4-5), the actual
       step size varies such that the numerical error is less than a specified
       threshold.
   
   Input
       This property specifies the input to the Stream Tracer
       filter.
   
   IntegrationDirection
       This property determines in which direction(s) a
       streamline is generated.
   
   IntegrationStepUnit
       This property specifies the unit for
       Minimum/Initial/Maximum integration step size. The Length unit refers
       to the arc length that a particle travels/advects within a single step.
       The Cell Length unit represents the step size as a number of
       cells.
   
   IntegratorType
       This property determines which integrator (with
       increasing accuracy) to use for creating streamlines.
   
   InterpolatorType
       This property determines which interpolator to use for
       evaluating the velocity vector field. The first is faster though the
       second is more robust in locating cells during streamline
       integration.
   
   MaximumError
       This property specifies the maximum error (for
       Runge-Kutta 4-5) tolerated throughout streamline integration. The
       Runge-Kutta 4-5 integrator tries to adjust the step size such that the
       estimated error is less than this threshold.
   
   MaximumStepLength
       When using the Runge-Kutta 4-5 integrator, this property
       specifies the maximum integration step size.
   
   MaximumSteps
       This property specifies the maximum number of steps,
       beyond which streamline integration is terminated.
   
   MaximumStreamlineLength
       This property specifies the maximum streamline length
       (i.e., physical arc length), beyond which line integration is
       terminated.
   
   MinimumStepLength
       When using the Runge-Kutta 4-5 integrator, this property
       specifies the minimum integration step size.
   
   SeedType
       The value of this property determines how the seeds for
       the streamlines will be generated.
   
   SurfaceStreamlines
       Specify whether or not to compute surface
       streamlines.
   
   TerminalSpeed
       This property specifies the terminal speed, below which
       particle advection/integration is terminated.
   
   Vectors
       This property contains the name of the vector array from
       which to generate streamlines.

   GetProperty(self, name)
       Given a property name, returns the property object.
   
   GetPropertyValue(self, name)
       Returns a scalar for properties with 1 elements, the property
       itself for vectors.
   
   InitializeFromProxy(self, aProxy, update=True)
       Constructor. Assigns proxy to self.SMProxy, updates the server
       object as well as register the proxy in _pyproxies dictionary.
   
   ListProperties(self)
       Returns a list of all property names on this proxy.
