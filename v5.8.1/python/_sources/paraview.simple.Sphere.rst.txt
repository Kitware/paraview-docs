Data Descriptors
----------------


   
   Center
       This property specifies the 3D coordinates for the
       center of the sphere.
   
   EndPhi
       The value of this property can be adjusted to form only
       a portion of a sphere. The value is measured in
       degrees.
   
   EndTheta
       The value of this property can be adjusted to form only
       a portion of a sphere. This value is measured in
       degrees.
   
   PhiResolution
       The value of this property represents the number of
       divisions between Start Phi and End Phi on the sphere. (See the Start
       Phi and End Phi properties.) The phi divisions are similar to latitude
       lines on the earth.
   
   Radius
       This property specifies the radius of the
       sphere.
   
   StartPhi
       To form a complete sphere, the value of this property
       should be 0 degrees, and the value of the End Phi property should be
       180 degrees. The value of this property can be adjusted to form only a
       portion of a sphere. Set the starting angle (in degrees) in the
       latitudinal direction.
   
   StartTheta
       To form a complete sphere, the value of this property
       should be 0 degrees, and the value of the End Theta property should be
       360 degrees. The value of this property can be adjusted to form only a
       portion of a sphere.
   
   ThetaResolution
       The value of this property represents the number of
       divisions between Start Theta and End Theta around the sphere. (See the
       Start Theta and End Theta properties.) The theta divisions are similar
       to longitude lines on the earth. The higher the resolution, the closer
       the approximation will come to a sphere, and the more polygons there
       will be.

Methods inherited from SourceProxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   FileNameChanged(self)
       Called when the filename of a source proxy is changed.
   
   GetCellDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetDataInformation(self, idx=None)
       This method returns a DataInformation wrapper around a
       vtkPVDataInformation
   
   GetFieldDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetPointDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated point data information.
   
   UpdatePipeline(self, time=None)
       This method updates the server-side VTK pipeline and the associated
       data information. Make sure to update a source to validate the output
       meta-data.
   
   UpdatePipelineInformation(self)
       This method updates the meta-data of the server-side VTK pipeline and
       the associated information properties
   
   __getitem__(self, idx)
       Given a slice, int or string, returns the corresponding
       output port
   
   

Methods inherited from Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   GetProperty(self, name)
       Given a property name, returns the property object.
   
   GetPropertyValue(self, name)
       Returns a scalar for properties with 1 elements, the property
       itself for vectors.
   
   InitializeFromProxy(self, aProxy, update=True)
       Constructor. Assigns proxy to self.SMProxy, updates the server
       object as well as register the proxy in _pyproxies dictionary.
   
   ListProperties(self)
       Returns a list of all property names on this proxy.
   
   SetPropertyWithName(self, pname, arg)
       Generic method for setting the value of a property.
   
   __del__(self)
       Destructor. Cleans up all observers as well as remove
       the proxy from the _pyproxies dictionary
   
   __eq__(self, other)
       Returns true if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __getattr__(self, name)
       With the exception of a few overloaded methods,
       returns the SMProxy method
   
   __hash__(self)
       Return hash(self).
   
   __init__(self, \*\*args)
       Default constructor. It can be used to initialize properties
       by passing keyword arguments where the key is the name of the
       property. In addition registrationGroup and registrationName (optional)
       can be specified (as keyword arguments) to automatically register
       the proxy with the proxy manager.
   
   __iter__(self)
       Creates an iterator for the properties.
   
   __ne__(self, other)
       Returns false if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __setattr__(self, name, value)
       Implement setattr(self, name, value).
   
   add_attribute(self, name, value)
