Data Descriptors
----------------


   
   Dimensions
       Load the grid with the given dimensions. Any arrays that
       conform to these dimensions will be loaded.
   
   FileName
       The name of the files to load.
   
   OutputType
       Specifies the type of data that the reader creates. If
       Automatic, the reader will use the most appropriate grid type for the
       data read. Note that not all grid types support all data. A warning is
       issued if a mismatch occurs.
   
   ReplaceFillValueWithNan
       If on, any float or double variable read that has a
       _FillValue attribute will have that fill value replaced with a
       not-a-number (NaN) value. The advantage of setting these to NaN values
       is that, if implemented properly by the system and careful math
       operations are used, they can implicitly be ignored by calculations
       like finding the range of the values. That said, this option should be
       used with caution as VTK does not fully support NaN values and
       therefore odd calculations may occur.
   
   SphericalCoordinates
       If on, then data with latitude/longitude dimensions will
       be read in as curvilinear data shaped like spherical coordinates. If
       false, then the data will always be read in Cartesian
       coordinates.
   
   TimestepValues
       This magic property sends time information to the
       animation panel. ParaView will then automatically set up the animation
       to visit the time steps defined in the file.
   
   VerticalBias
       The bias of the vertical component of spherical
       coordinates. It is common to write the vertical component with respect
       to something other than the center of the sphere (for example, the
       surface). In this case, it might be necessary to scale and/or bias the
       vertical height. The height will become height\*scale + bias. Keep in
       mind that if the positive attribute of the vertical dimension is down,
       then the height is negated. The scaling will be adjusted if it results
       in invalid (negative) vertical values.
   
   VerticalScale
       The scale of the vertical component of spherical
       coordinates. It is common to write the vertical component with respect
       to something other than the center of the sphere (for example, the
       surface). In this case, it might be necessary to scale and/or bias the
       vertical height. The height will become height\*scale + bias. Keep in
       mind that if the positive attribute of the vertical dimension is down,
       then the height is negated. The scaling will be adjusted if it results
       in invalid (negative) vertical values.

Methods inherited from SourceProxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   FileNameChanged(self)
       Called when the filename of a source proxy is changed.
   
   GetCellDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetDataInformation(self, idx=None)
       This method returns a DataInformation wrapper around a
       vtkPVDataInformation
   
   GetFieldDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetPointDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated point data information.
   
   UpdatePipeline(self, time=None)
       This method updates the server-side VTK pipeline and the associated
       data information. Make sure to update a source to validate the output
       meta-data.
   
   UpdatePipelineInformation(self)
       This method updates the meta-data of the server-side VTK pipeline and
       the associated information properties
   
   __getitem__(self, idx)
       Given a slice, int or string, returns the corresponding
       output port
   
   

Methods inherited from Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   GetProperty(self, name)
       Given a property name, returns the property object.
   
   GetPropertyValue(self, name)
       Returns a scalar for properties with 1 elements, the property
       itself for vectors.
   
   InitializeFromProxy(self, aProxy, update=True)
       Constructor. Assigns proxy to self.SMProxy, updates the server
       object as well as register the proxy in _pyproxies dictionary.
   
   ListProperties(self)
       Returns a list of all property names on this proxy.
   
   SetPropertyWithName(self, pname, arg)
       Generic method for setting the value of a property.
   
   __del__(self)
       Destructor. Cleans up all observers as well as remove
       the proxy from the _pyproxies dictionary
   
   __eq__(self, other)
       Returns true if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __getattr__(self, name)
       With the exception of a few overloaded methods,
       returns the SMProxy method
   
   __hash__(self)
       Return hash(self).
   
   __init__(self, \*\*args)
       Default constructor. It can be used to initialize properties
       by passing keyword arguments where the key is the name of the
       property. In addition registrationGroup and registrationName (optional)
       can be specified (as keyword arguments) to automatically register
       the proxy with the proxy manager.
   
   __iter__(self)
       Creates an iterator for the properties.
   
   __ne__(self, other)
       Returns false if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __setattr__(self, name, value)
       Implement setattr(self, name, value).
   
   add_attribute(self, name, value)
