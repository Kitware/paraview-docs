Data Descriptors
----------------


   
   ClosedLoopMaximumDistance
       Loops are considered closed if the have two points at
       distance less than this. This is expressed in IntegrationStepUnit.
   
   ComputeVorticity
       Specify whether or not to compute
       vorticity.
   
   InitialStepLength
       This property specifies the initial integration step
       size. For non-adaptive integrators (Runge-Kutta 2 and Runge-Kutta 4),
       it is fixed (always equal to this initial value) throughout the
       integration.
   
   Input
       This property specifies the input to the filter.
   
   IntegrationStepUnit
       This property specifies the unit for
       Initial integration step size. The Length unit refers
       to the arc length that a particle travels/advects within a single step.
       The Cell Length unit represents the step size as a number of
       cells.
   
   IntegratorType
       This property determines which integrator (with
       increasing accuracy) to use for creating streamlines.
   
   InterpolatorType
       This property determines which interpolator to use for
       evaluating the velocity vector field. The first is faster though the
       second is more robust in locating cells during streamline
       integration.
   
   MaximumSteps
       This property specifies the maximum number of steps,
       beyond which streamline integration is terminated.
   
   SeparatingDistance
       Specify the separating distance between
       streamlines expressed in IntegrationStepUnit.
   
   SeparatingDistanceRatio
       Specifies SeparatingDistanceRatio. If streamlines
       get closer than SeparatingDistance \* SeparatingDistanceRatio to
       other streamlines integration stops.
   
   StartPosition
       Specify the starting point (seed) of the first streamline
       in the global coordinate system.
   
   TerminalSpeed
       This property specifies the terminal speed, below which
       particle advection/integration is terminated.
   
   Vectors
       This property contains the name of the vector array from
       which to generate streamlines.

       Called when the filename of a source proxy is changed.
   
   GetCellDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetDataInformation(self, idx=None)
       This method returns a DataInformation wrapper around a
       vtkPVDataInformation

       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetPointDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated point data information.
   
   UpdatePipeline(self, time=None)
       This method updates the server-side VTK pipeline and the associated
       data information. Make sure to update a source to validate the output
       meta-data.
   
   UpdatePipelineInformation(self)
       This method updates the meta-data of the server-side VTK pipeline and
       the associated information properties
   
   __getitem__(self, idx)
       Given a slice, int or string, returns the corresponding
       output port

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   GetProperty(self, name)
       Given a property name, returns the property object.
   
   GetPropertyValue(self, name)
       Returns a scalar for properties with 1 elements, the property
       itself for vectors.
   
   InitializeFromProxy(self, aProxy, update=True)
       Constructor. Assigns proxy to self.SMProxy, updates the server
       object as well as register the proxy in _pyproxies dictionary.
   
   ListProperties(self)
       Returns a list of all property names on this proxy.
   
   SetPropertyWithName(self, pname, arg)
       Generic method for setting the value of a property.
   
   __del__(self)
       Destructor. Cleans up all observers as well as remove
       the proxy from the _pyproxies dictionary
   
   __eq__(self, other)
       Returns true if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __getattr__(self, name)
       With the exception of a few overloaded methods,
       returns the SMProxy method
   
   __hash__(self)
   
   __init__(self, \*\*args)
       Default constructor. It can be used to initialize properties
       by passing keyword arguments where the key is the name of the
       property. In addition registrationGroup and registrationName (optional)
       can be specified (as keyword arguments) to automatically register
       the proxy with the proxy manager.
   
   __iter__(self)
       Creates an iterator for the properties.
   
   __ne__(self, other)
       Returns false if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __setattr__(self, name, value)
   
   add_attribute(self, name, value)
