Data Descriptors
----------------


   
   FlipNormals
       Flip the normals.
   
   Input
       This property specifies the input from which the normals are estimated.
   
   NormalOrientation
       Orientation mode of the normals.
   
   OrientationPoint
       Point used to orient the normals.
   
   Radius
       Radius of the sphere to use for the search of nearest neighbors.
   
   SampleSize
       Number of points to sample for PCA.
   
   SearchMode
       Configure how the filter selects the neighbor points used to calculate the PCA. With KNN mode K (SampleSize) points are selected regardless of their location relative to the sampled point. The radius can also be set to ensure that a sufficiently large neighborhood is taken into account, if not (i.e. all points fall inside the radius), the second approach is performed. With Radius mode, neighboring points are selected inside a radius (RADIUS), only the neighborhood of the sampled point is considered. If K (SampleSize) is also set, the number of points found inside the radius must be larger than K, if not the first approach is performed. Both approaches give the same results. The first approach is faster for uniform point clouds, in other cases, the second approach is faster.

   Initialize = aInitialize(self, connection=None, update=True)
   
   

Methods inherited from SourceProxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   FileNameChanged(self)
       Called when the filename of a source proxy is changed.
   
   GetCellDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetDataInformation(self, idx=None)
       This method returns a DataInformation wrapper around a
       vtkPVDataInformation
   
   GetFieldDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated cell data information.
   
   GetPointDataInformation(self)
       Returns the associated point data information.
   
   UpdatePipeline(self, time=None)
       This method updates the server-side VTK pipeline and the associated
       data information. Make sure to update a source to validate the output
       meta-data.
   
   UpdatePipelineInformation(self)
       This method updates the meta-data of the server-side VTK pipeline and
       the associated information properties
   
   __getitem__(self, idx)
       Given a slice, int or string, returns the corresponding
       output port
   
   

Methods inherited from Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   
   GetProperty(self, name)
       Given a property name, returns the property object.
   
   GetPropertyValue(self, name)
       Returns a scalar for properties with 1 elements, the property
       itself for vectors.
   
   InitializeFromProxy(self, aProxy, update=True)
       Constructor. Assigns proxy to self.SMProxy, updates the server
       object as well as register the proxy in _pyproxies dictionary.
   
   ListProperties(self)
       Returns a list of all property names on this proxy.
   
   SetPropertyWithName(self, pname, arg)
       Generic method for setting the value of a property.
   
   __del__(self)
       Destructor. Cleans up all observers as well as remove
       the proxy from the _pyproxies dictionary
   
   __eq__(self, other)
       Returns true if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __getattr__(self, name)
       With the exception of a few overloaded methods,
       returns the SMProxy method
   
   __hash__(self)
       Return hash(self).
   
   __init__(self, \*\*args)
       Default constructor. It can be used to initialize properties
       by passing keyword arguments where the key is the name of the
       property. In addition registrationGroup and registrationName (optional)
       can be specified (as keyword arguments) to automatically register
       the proxy with the proxy manager.
   
   __iter__(self)
       Creates an iterator for the properties.
   
   __ne__(self, other)
       Returns false if the underlying SMProxies are the same.
   
   __setattr__(self, name, value)
       Implement setattr(self, name, value).
   
   add_attribute(self, name, value)
